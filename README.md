# spatial-framework-for-hadoop

The __Spatial Framework for Hadoop__ allows developers and data scientists to use the Hadoop data processing system 
for spatial data analysis.

For tools and samples that use this framework, head over 
to [GIS Tools for Hadoop](https://github.com/Esri/gis-tools-for-hadoop).

## Features

* **[JSON Utilities](https://github.com/Esri/spatial-framework-for-hadoop/wiki/JSON-Utilities)** - Utilities 
for interacting with JSON exported from ArcGIS
 * [Javadoc](http://esri.github.com/spatial-framework-for-hadoop/json/)
* **[Hive Spatial](https://github.com/Esri/spatial-framework-for-hadoop/wiki/Hive-Spatial)** - User-Defined 
Functions and SerDes for spatial analysis in Hive
 * [UDF Documentation](https://github.com/Esri/spatial-framework-for-hadoop/wiki/UDF-Documentation)
 * [JSON Serde](https://github.com/Esri/spatial-framework-for-hadoop/wiki/Hive-JSON-SerDe)

## Getting Started

At the root level of this repository, you can build a single jar with everything in the framework 
using [Apache Ant](http://ant.apache.org/).  Alternatively, you can build a jar at the root level of each 
framework component (i.e., `hive\build.xml`).

The build files use [Maven Ant Tasks](http://maven.apache.org/ant-tasks/download.html) for dependency 
management. You will need the jar in a place Ant can find it (i.e., `~/.ant/lib/maven-ant-tasks-2.1.3.jar`).

## Dependencies

* [Esri Geometry API for Java](https://github.com/Esri/geometry-api-java) - Java geometry library for spatial data 
processing.

## Requirements

* Hive 0.10.0 and above (or Hive 0.9.0 patched with [HIVE-2736](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-2736))
* Workflows calling MapReduce jobs require the location of the custom job to be run.
* Custom MapReduce jobs that use the Esri Geometry API require that the developer has authored the job, 
(referencing the com.esri.geometry.\* classes), and deployed the job Jar file to the Hadoop system, prior to the 
ArcGIS user submitting the workflow file.

* [ArcGIS Geodata Resource Center]( http://resources.arcgis.com/en/communities/geodata/)
